# Why View Exports SVG Exists

As a front-end developer, I ran into a problem that many teams know too well.

A massive project with a single icon file containing more than **10,000 lines of SVG components**.

Finding the right icon was painful:

- Multiple variants with unclear names
- No visual reference without importing and running the project
- Endless cycles of import → compile → check → repeat
- New icons added even when similar ones already existed

What should have been a simple task became a constant source of wasted time.

**View Exports SVG was created to solve this exact problem** — bringing visibility, structure, and speed to SVG component workflows directly inside the editor.
