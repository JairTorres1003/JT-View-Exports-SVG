# Overview

**View Exports SVG** is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps developers discover, preview, and manage SVG component libraries in modern front-end projects.

In projects with growing icon sets, understanding what SVG components exist and how they are structured can become difficult. View Exports SVG provides a unified, editor-native interface to explore SVG components without leaving VS Code.

## What It Does

The extension scans your workspace and extracts exported SVG components from:

- JavaScript (`.js`)
- TypeScript (`.ts`)
- JSX / TSX (`.jsx`, `.tsx`)

It uses **Babel AST traversal** to accurately detect SVG components in React, Preact, and other JSX-based frameworks.

## Key Capabilities

View Exports SVG provides tools for working with SVG components at scale:

- **Workspace-wide Discovery**
  Scans the entire project and lists all exported SVG components.

- **Interactive DevTools Panel**
  A dockable panel for previewing components and accessing related actions.

- **Real-time Playground**
  Edit component properties in an embedded editor and preview changes instantly.

- **Component Metadata**
  Displays export type, animation detection, and usage status.

- **Multi-language Support**
  Interface available in over 15 languages.

:::note
View Exports SVG is designed to work with both small projects and large icon libraries, adapting to different project structures and export patterns.
