# Overview

**View Exports SVG** is a Visual Studio Code extension that simplifies how developers discover, visualize, and manage SVG component libraries in modern front-end projects.

Managing large collections of SVG icons can quickly become a productivity bottleneck. View Exports SVG addresses this by providing a unified interface to explore, preview, and interact with SVG components directly inside VS Code.

## What It Does

The extension scans your workspace and extracts SVG component exports from:

- JavaScript (`.js`)
- TypeScript (`.ts`)
- JSX / TSX (`.jsx`, `.tsx`)

It uses **Babel AST traversal** to accurately detect exported SVG components in React, Preact, and other JSX-based frameworks.

## Key Capabilities

View Exports SVG provides a complete toolset for SVG component management:

- **Workspace-wide Discovery**
  Automatically finds all exported SVG components across your project.

- **Interactive DevTools Panel**
  A dockable panel with component previews, search, and quick actions.

- **Real-time Playground**
  Modify component properties in a editor and preview changes instantly.

- **Component Management**
  Mark favorites, track recently used icons, and organize components efficiently.

- **Multi-language Support**
  Interface available in over 15 languages.

:::note
View Exports SVG is designed to scale from small projects to large icon libraries, offering simple discovery for beginners and advanced features like custom grouping patterns and performance optimizations for power users.
