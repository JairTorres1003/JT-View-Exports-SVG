# 🎯 Your First SVG

Now that **View Exports SVG** is running, let's walk through your **first real interaction** with an SVG component.

This section shows how to:
- Locate an SVG component
- Preview it instantly
- Copy and use it in your code

---

## 🔍 Finding an SVG Component

After opening the extension, you'll see a grid containing all detected SVG components in your project.

Each item represents:
- An exported SVG-based component
- A live preview
- A set of quick actions

You don't need to open files or search manually.

---

## 👁 Previewing the Icon

1. Click on any icon in the grid.
2. The **DevTools panel** opens automatically [(default behavior)](#replace-real-path).
3. You'll see:
   - A live preview of the icon
   - The component rendered in real time
   - Default props applied

This allows you to visually confirm the icon before using it.

---

## 📋 Copying the Component Name

To use the icon in your code:

- **Single click** on the icon card
  → The component name is copied to your clipboard.

Example usage in React:

```tsx
import { SearchIcon } from '@/your-real-import-path'

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <SearchIcon />
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```

No guessing, no typos, no trial-and-error imports.
