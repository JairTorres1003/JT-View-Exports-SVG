## 🧩 Playground Overview

The **Playground** lets you test and preview your icons dynamically.
It includes a live editor, background color selector, and several quick actions.

### ✏️ Real-time Editing

Use the built-in editor to modify your icon's props in real time. The playground updates instantly.

You can toggle or adjust the preview's background color to visualize icons under different contrast conditions.

</div>

:::tip Pro tip
The editor includes autocomplete and contextual suggestions. You can see them by typing the name
of a property inside the component or by opening the `<` symbol to show suggestions for all
components.

#### Quick editor actions

In the editor toolbar you'll find several quick-access buttons:

- Hide/Show code — Toggles the editor's visibility.
- Copy code — Copies the current code to the clipboard.
- Reset code — Restores the editor to its initial state.
- More actions (three dots icon) — Opens a menu with additional options:
  - **Open in Editor** — Jump directly to the component's source file.
  - **Copy as SVG / PNG** — Copies the rendered version to clipboard.
  - **Download as SVG / PNG** — Saves the icon to your local machine.

### 🎨 Background & Color Picker

  <div>![Background color picker in the DevTools Playground.](/screens/playground-color-picker.webp)</div>
  <div className='-mt-4'>
    Use the color picker to set a custom background color for the playground. This is especially
    useful when working with icons that have transparent or semi-transparent elements.
    <br />
    In addition to those scenarios, it's also useful for testing different color combinations and
    contrast levels.

The menu includes the following options:

- **Reload Playground** — Resets the preview and editor.
- **Enable Word Wrap** — Toggles line wrapping in the editor.
- **Reload Editor** — Rebuilds the code editor.
