The **DevTools panel** is the advanced workspace where you can inspect, preview, and edit SVG components in real time—without leaving Visual Studio Code.

It is designed to help you:
- Visually validate icons before using them
- Experiment with props and styles
- Inspect component metadata and structure

## 🧠 DevTools Overview

The DevTools panel is divided into two main sections:

- **Playground** — Interactive editor and live preview
- **Component Info** — Read-only metadata about the selected icon

Each section updates automatically when you select a different component.

---

## 🧩 Playground

The **Playground** lets you experiment with SVG components dynamically.
It combines a live preview, a real-time code editor, and quick-access actions.

### ✏️ Real-time Editing

Use the built-in editor to modify your component props.
All changes are reflected instantly in the preview.

</div>

:::tip Pro tip
The editor includes autocomplete and contextual suggestions. You can see them by typing the name
of a property inside the component or by opening the `<` symbol to show suggestions for all
components.

### ⚡ Quick Editor Actions

The editor toolbar provides quick access to common actions:

- **Show / Hide code** — Toggle editor visibility
- **Copy code** — Copy the current editor content
- **Reset code** — Restore the initial state

Additional actions are available under the **More actions** menu:

- **Open in Editor**
- **Copy as SVG / PNG**
- **Download as SVG / PNG**

### 🎨 Background & Contrast Testing

  <div className='-mt-4'>
    Use the color picker to set a custom background color for the playground. This is especially
    useful when working with icons that have transparent or semi-transparent elements.
    <br />
    In addition to those scenarios, it's also useful for testing different color combinations and
    contrast levels.

The menu includes the following options:

- **Reload Playground** — Resets the preview and editor.
- **Enable Word Wrap** — Toggles line wrapping in the editor.
- **Reload Editor** — Rebuilds the code editor.
