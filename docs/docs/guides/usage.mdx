description: Learn how to use View Exports SVG to preview, browse, and manage SVG components in Visual Studio Code.
---

Once **View Exports SVG** is installed and running, you can browse, preview, and manage SVG components directly inside Visual Studio Code.

This guide focuses on the **day-to-day workflow**: how to explore icons, interact with them, and use them efficiently in your project.

---

## 🔄 Core Workflow

The typical workflow with View Exports SVG looks like this:

1. Open the extension (context menu or command palette)
2. Browse detected SVG components in a grid
3. Preview icons visually
4. Copy, export, or edit them using built-in tools

The following sections explain each step in detail.

## 🧭 Opening the Extension

You can open **View Exports SVG** at any time using:

- The **context menu** on files or folders

## ⚙️ Browsing Icons

Once opened, the panel displays all detected SVG components in a grid layout.

Each item shows:
- A live preview
- The component name
- Quick actions

## 🎯 Interacting with Icons

### Click Actions
- Copy component name to clipboard
- Open the DevTools panel
- Add to recent icons (configurable)

### Favorites
- Hover an icon
- Click the ⭐ star to mark or unmark

### Context Menu
Right-click an icon to:
- Copy name or code snippet
- Open in editor
- Copy as PNG or SVG
- Download as PNG or SVG

## 👁 Previewing and Editing Icons

Selecting an icon opens the **DevTools panel**, where you can:

- Preview icons in real time
- Edit props in the playground
- Reset or export results

For advanced editing features, see:
[**DevTools Panel →**](/docs/guides/devtools)

## 🧩 Alternative Workflow: Drag & Drop

You can also drag and drop files directly into the extension start screen.

This workflow is useful when:
- Exploring icons outside the workspace
- Testing individual files quickly

<div align='center' className='mt-4'>
  <video src='/screens/upload-files-drag-drop.webm' controls muted />
  <p className='mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400'>Drag & Drop files into the View Exports SVG panel to preview their SVG components.</p>
</div>

:::caution Security Limitation
Due to VS Code's WebView sandbox restrictions, direct access to file paths is blocked.\
When you drag and drop files into the panel, the extension reads their contents and creates temporary
in-memory versions for safe preview.
