The **DevTools panel** is where you can inspect, preview, and edit your SVG components directly from within **Visual Studio Code**.
It's divided into two main sections: the **Playground** and the **Component Info** panel.

## 📍 Location in the UI

To access the DevTools panel, first open the `View Exports SVG` panel. Then, you can open the DevTools in any of the following ways:

1. Click the icon of the component you want to view or edit.
2. Click the button located in the top-right corner of the panel.
3. Drag from the right edge to dock or undock the panel.

The image labels the points that indicate where each action is located.

## 🧩 Playground Overview

The **Playground** lets you test and preview your icons dynamically.
It includes a live editor, background color selector, and several quick actions.

### ✏️ Real-time Editing

Use the built-in editor to modify your icon's props in real time. The playground updates instantly.

You can toggle or adjust the preview's background color to visualize icons under different contrast conditions.

<Aside type='tip' title='Pro tip'>
  The editor includes autocomplete and contextual suggestions. You can see them by typing the name
  of a property inside the component or by opening the `<` symbol to show suggestions for all
  components.
</Aside>

#### Quick editor actions

In the editor toolbar you'll find several quick-access buttons:

- Hide/Show code — Toggles the editor's visibility.
- Copy code — Copies the current code to the clipboard.
- Reset code — Restores the editor to its initial state.
- More actions (three dots icon) — Opens a menu with additional options:
  - **Open in Editor** — Jump directly to the component's source file.
  - **Copy as SVG / PNG** — Copies the rendered version to clipboard.
  - **Download as SVG / PNG** — Saves the icon to your local machine.

### 🎨 Background & Color Picker

  <CardGrid>
    <Figure
      src={PlaygroundColorPicker}
      caption='Background color picker in the DevTools Playground.'
    />
    <div>
      Use the color picker to set a custom background color for the playground. This is especially
      useful when working with icons that have transparent or semi-transparent elements.
      <br />
      In addition to those scenarios, it's also useful for testing different color combinations and
      contrast levels.

### 🧰 Playground Menu Actions

At the top-right of the Playground, you'll find an **actions menu** (three dots icon) for managing the environment.

The menu includes the following options:

- **Reload Playground** — Resets the preview and editor.
- **Enable Word Wrap** — Toggles line wrapping in the editor.
- **Reload Editor** — Rebuilds the code editor.

## ℹ️ Info Component Overview

Below the Playground, you'll find the **Component Info** section.

It displays metadata about the selected component, including:

| Field                | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Component name**   | The exported name of the icon component.         |
| **Type declaration** | Whether it's defined as a variable or function.  |
| **Is exported?**     | Indicates if the component is publicly exported. |
| **Is animated?**     | Detects motion or animation within the SVG.      |
| **Is favorite?**     | Shows whether it's marked as favorite.           |
