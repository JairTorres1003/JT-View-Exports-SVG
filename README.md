'**View Exports SVG**' is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that transforms how you interact with SVG icons in your projects. It goes beyond simple viewing, offering a complete suite of tools to scan your workspace, preview components in an interactive playground, and manage your assets with an intuitive DevTools panel.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Advanced DevTools Panel:** A dockable, full-featured panel with a component viewer, search, and management tools.
- **Interactive Playground:** Select any icon to preview it, edit its properties in a real-time code editor, and see your changes instantly.
- **Workspace-wide Scanning:** Automatically discover all SVG components across your entire project, not just in specific files.
- **Component Management:** Mark icons as **favorites**, see your **recently used** components, and get quick access to what matters most.
- **Multiple Ways to View:** Launch the viewer from the context menu, the command palette, or by dragging and dropping files.
- **Powerful Actions:** Copy component names, download as SVG/PNG, or open the source file directly from the UI.
- **Broad Framework Support:** Works out-of-the-box with JavaScript/TypeScript projects using frameworks like React, Preact, and more. ([See Full SVG Support](SVG%20SUPPORT.md)).
- **Native Theming:** The interface automatically adapts to your current VS Code theme for a seamless experience.
