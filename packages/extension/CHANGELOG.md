# View Exports SVG - Changelog

## 5.0.1

_May 25, 2026_

#### ✨ Features

- **Capture Pattern Grouping (`${N}`):**
  - `groupPatterns` keys now support `${N}` placeholders to capture dynamic path segments.
  - Labels can reference captured values with `${N}` to generate dynamic group names.
  - Example: `"**/icons/${0}/**": "Icons - ${0}"` groups `icons/flags/brazil.tsx` under `Icons - flags`.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Extension README logo:** Fixed logo not displaying correctly.
- **Component grouping patterns:** Fixed `groupPatterns` not matching correctly due to incorrect micromatch options.

#### 🚀 Enhancements

- **Unit tests:** Re-enabled unit tests that were accidentally disabled.
- **Webview environment validation:** Removed unnecessary environment variable validation — not required in production builds.

## 5.0.0

_May 20, 2026_

#### ✨ Features

- **Monorepo Architecture (pnpm workspaces):**
  - Project migrated to a monorepo with pnpm workspaces.
  - Packages: `core`, `extension`, `webview`, `server`, `docs`, `extension-api`.
  - Shared logic centralized in `@jt-view-exports-svg/core`.
  - Server migrated from Deno to Node.js.

- **New Extension ↔ Webview Messaging System:**
  - Complete redesign with `MessageRouter`, `WebviewMessenger`, and `PanelController`.
  - Typed message maps (`PostMessageMap` / `ReceiveMessageMap`) for safe cross-boundary communication.
  - Eliminates message loss on webview startup.
  - New capabilities: component reload, global expand/collapse toggle, file open from editor, DevTools sync, UI ↔ extension state synchronization.

- **Icon Collections System:**
  - Replaced `recentIcons.*` settings with a unified `iconCollection` configuration.
  - Separate limits for `recent` and `favorite` collections (range: 0–100, default: 10 each).
  - Collections can be cleared independently or together.

- **Cache Management — Three Clearing Modes:**
  - Clear Cache: removes scanned file/component data, preserves collections.
  - Clear Collections Cache: removes recent and favorite icons only.
  - Clear All Cache: full cache wipe including collections.
  - Available from the Command Palette and via a submenu in the editor/title action bar.

- **Configuration Service Redesign:**
  - Clearer, modular configuration architecture.
  - Extension view reloads automatically when settings change.

#### 🚀 Enhancements

- **Vite 8 Migration:**
  - Upgraded from `rolldown-vite@7` to `vite@8` for improved build performance and ESM compatibility.

- **Pattern Matching — micromatch:**
  - Replaced `minimatch` with `micromatch` for file grouping patterns.

- **Dynamic Theme Loading:**
  - VS Code theme resources now loaded dynamically via PostMessage interception.
  - No longer clones theme files into extension assets.
  - Smaller extension bundle, faster initial load, and full VS Code Web compatibility.

- **Redux Store — Slice Architecture:**
  - Webview state migrated to specialized Redux slices.
  - Typed hooks (`useAppSelector`, `useAppDispatch`).
  - Removed redundant computed states.

- **i18n Improvements:**
  - Reorganized translations for both extension (`package.nls.json`, `bundle.l10n.json`) and webview.
  - Namespace-based organization, normalized keys, automated migration scripts.

- **Cache Architecture Redesign:**
  - Separated into `FilesCache`, theme cache, component export cache, and per-collection icon cache.
  - Better control over partial/full invalidation and concurrency.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed DevTools close (X) button not updating extension state when dismissed.
- Fixed expand/collapse toggle requiring double-click in some scenarios.
- Fixed component reload not respecting active search filter.

#### 📈 Performance Improvements

- **Concurrent Workspace Scanning:** File discovery now runs concurrently — significantly faster in large projects.
- **Concurrent File Processing (AST):** Component extraction parallelized across files.
- Reduced memory usage with AST cleanup and optimized SVG extraction.

#### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Removed settings:**
  - `JT-View-Exports-SVG.recentIcons.showIcons` — use `JT-View-Exports-SVG.iconCollection.recent` (set to `0` to hide)
  - `JT-View-Exports-SVG.recentIcons.limitShowIcons` — use `JT-View-Exports-SVG.iconCollection` (`recent` field)
- **Node.js:** Minimum version now `22.x`.
- **Dev server:** Migrated from Deno to Node.js. Deno-based server scripts no longer work.
- **Monorepo:** Project structure changed — contributors must use `pnpm` and run `pnpm setup` after cloning.

#### 📝 Migration Guide

**For Users:**
Update the extension from the VS Code Marketplace. If you had `recentIcons.*` settings configured, replace them with:

```json
"JT-View-Exports-SVG.iconCollection": {
  "recent": 10,
  "favorite": 10
}
```

**For Contributors:**

- Run `pnpm setup` from the monorepo root.
- Use `pnpm dev:webview` + `pnpm dev:extension` for development.
- Minimum Node.js `22.x` required.
