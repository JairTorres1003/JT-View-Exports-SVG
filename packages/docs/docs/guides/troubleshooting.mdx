title: Troubleshooting
description: Common issues, limitations, and solutions when using View Exports SVG.
---

This page helps you diagnose and resolve common issues when working with **View Exports SVG**.

Most problems are related to **export patterns**, **unsupported SVG structures**, or **VS Code WebView limitations**.

---

## 🔍 Icons Are Not Detected

### Problem

The extension scans your files, but no icons appear in the panel.

### Possible Causes

- The SVG component is **not exported**
- The file does not contain a valid JSX-based SVG component
- The file is located inside an ignored directory

### What to Check

1. Ensure the component is exported:

   ```tsx
   export const MyIcon = () => <svg>...</svg>
   ```

2. Verify the file type:
   - `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx` only

3. Confirm the directory is not ignored:

   ```json
   "JT-View-Exports-SVG.ignoreDirectories": [
     "**/dist",
     "**/node_modules"
   ]
   ```

4. Check supported SVG structures. See [**SVG Support →**](/docs/resources/svg-support)

---

## 🚫 Icons Exist but Do Not Render

### Problem

Icons appear in the panel but show empty previews or render incorrectly.

### Explanation

View Exports SVG only supports **valid SVG JSX structures**.
Unsupported tags or malformed attributes can prevent rendering.

### Common Causes

- Unsupported SVG elements
- Dynamic SVG generation
- Invalid JSX attributes

### Solution

- Simplify the SVG structure
- Replace unsupported tags
- Verify attributes match JSX syntax

Further details on supported structures can be found in [**SVG Support →**](/docs/resources/svg-support).

## 🧠 Not Exported Icons Not Showing

### Problem

You know the icon exists in the file, but it does not appear.

### Explanation

By default, **only exported components are shown**.

### Solution

Enable this option:

```json
"JT-View-Exports-SVG.showNotExportedIcons": true
```

---

## 🖱️ Drag & Drop Files Lose Original Path

### Problem

After dragging files into the panel, the original file path is lost.

### Why This Happens

This is a **VS Code WebView security restriction**.

WebViews do not have permission to access real OS file paths when files are dropped into them.

### How the Extension Handles It

To safely preview dropped files, View Exports SVG:

- Reads the file content
- Sends it via `postMessage`
- Creates a **temporary in-memory representation**
- Renders the SVG without accessing the real file system

This approach ensures security while still allowing previews.

### VS Code Limitation (Reference)

:::caution Known Limitation
This behavior is a known limitation in VS Code WebViews.
You can follow the technical discussion and current status on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/255608?meta-props=[isExternal=true;showAnchorIcon=true])

## ⚙️ DevTools Do Not Open Automatically

### Problem

Clicking an icon does not open the DevTools panel.

### Solution

Check this setting:

```json
"JT-View-Exports-SVG.defaultClickToOpenDevTools": true
```

Or open DevTools manually from:

- Icon actions menu
- Panel toolbar

See [**DevTools Panel →**](/docs/guides/devtools)

---

## 🧪 Playground Editor Issues

### Problem

The playground editor behaves unexpectedly or becomes unresponsive.

### Recommended Actions

- Use **Reload Playground**
- Use **Reload Editor**
- Disable **Word Wrap** if layout breaks

All options are available in the [**Playground Menu**](/docs/guides/devtools#-playground-menu-actions).

---

## 🧹 Cache or Scan Feels Outdated

### Problem

New icons are not detected or removed icons still appear.

### Explanation

The extension uses **smart caching** for performance.

### Solution

Run these commands in order:

1. `View Exports SVG: Clear Cache`
2. `View Exports SVG: Start Scanning`

This ensures the cache is cleared before rescanning your files.

---

## 🛠️ Debugging Errors

### If You See Errors

1. Open VS Code Developer Tools
   (`Help → Toggle Developer Tools`)
2. Check the **Console** for logs
3. Look for parsing or AST-related errors
