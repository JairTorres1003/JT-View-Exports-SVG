# Why View Exports SVG Exists

As a front-end developer, I ran into a problem that many teams know too well.

A massive project with a single icon file containing more than **10,000 lines of SVG components**.

Finding the right icon was painful:

- Multiple variants with unclear names
- No visual reference without importing and running the project
- Endless cycles of import → compile → check → repeat
- New icons added even when similar ones already existed

What should have been a simple task became a constant source of wasted time.

This experience revealed a clear gap in the developer workflow:
there was no fast, visual, and editor-native way to explore SVG components at scale.

**View Exports SVG was created to fill that gap**, bringing visibility and structure to SVG component libraries directly inside Visual Studio Code.
